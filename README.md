# SwordSoundApp
An app that detects when the device is in a pocket. When the user takes out the phone, it plays a sword unsheathing sound.

I got the idea for this app from Reddit. During development, I didn't find any implementation of detection if the device in a pocket. So, I made it myself.

Download my app from google drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fUDwH7exnwG5W3V92vNawcaTErK8Ks03/view?usp=sharing
